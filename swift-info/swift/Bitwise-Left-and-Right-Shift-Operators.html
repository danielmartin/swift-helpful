<span id="Bitwise-Left-and-Right-Shift-Operators-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">32.1.5 Bitwise Left and Right Shift Operators</h4>

<p>The <em>bitwise left shift operator</em> (&lsquo;<samp>&lt;&lt;</samp>&rsquo;) and <em>bitwise right shift
operator</em> (&lsquo;<samp>&gt;&gt;</samp>&rsquo;) move all bits in a number to the left or the right by a
certain number of places, according to the rules defined below.
</p>
<p>Bitwise left and right shifts have the effect of multiplying or dividing
an integer by a factor of two. Shifting an integer&rsquo;s bits to the left by
one position doubles its value, whereas shifting it to the right by one
position halves its value.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Shifting Behavior for Unsigned Integers


<p>The bit-shifting behavior for unsigned integers is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Existing bits are moved to the left or right by the requested number
of places.

</li><li> Any bits that are moved beyond the bounds of the integer&rsquo;s storage
are discarded.

</li><li> Zeros are inserted in the spaces left behind after the original bits
are moved to the left or right.
</li></ol>

<p>This approach is known as a <em>logical shift</em>.
</p>
<p>The illustration below shows the results of &lsquo;<samp>11111111 &lt;&lt; 1</samp>&rsquo; (which is
&lsquo;<samp>11111111</samp>&rsquo; shifted to the left by &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; place), and &lsquo;<samp>11111111 &gt;&gt; 1</samp>&rsquo; (which
is &lsquo;<samp>11111111</samp>&rsquo; shifted to the right by &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; place). Blue numbers are
shifted, gray numbers are discarded, and orange zeros are inserted:
</p>
<img src="_images/bitshiftUnsigned_2x.png" alt="_images/bitshiftUnsigned_2x">
<p>Here&rsquo;s how bit shifting looks in Swift code:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let shiftBits: UInt8 = 4 // 00000100 in binary
shiftBits &lt;&lt; 1 // 00001000
shiftBits &lt;&lt; 2 // 00010000
shiftBits &lt;&lt; 5 // 10000000
shiftBits &lt;&lt; 6 // 00000000
shiftBits &gt;&gt; 2 // 00000001
</pre></div>

<p>You can use bit shifting to encode and decode values within other data
types:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let pink: UInt32 = 0xCC6699
let redComponent = (pink &amp; 0xFF0000) &gt;&gt; 16 // redComponent is 0xCC, or 204
let greenComponent = (pink &amp; 0x00FF00) &gt;&gt; 8 // greenComponent is 0x66, or 102
let blueComponent = pink &amp; 0x0000FF // blueComponent is 0x99, or 153
</pre></div>

<p>This example uses a &lsquo;<samp>UInt32</samp>&rsquo; constant called &lsquo;<samp>pink</samp>&rsquo; to store a Cascading
Style Sheets color value for the color pink. The CSS color value
&lsquo;<samp>#CC6699</samp>&rsquo; is written as &lsquo;<samp>0xCC6699</samp>&rsquo; in Swift&rsquo;s hexadecimal number
representation. This color is then decomposed into its red (&lsquo;<samp>CC</samp>&rsquo;), green
(&lsquo;<samp>66</samp>&rsquo;), and blue (&lsquo;<samp>99</samp>&rsquo;) components by the bitwise AND operator (&lsquo;<samp>&amp;</samp>&rsquo;) and
the bitwise right shift operator (&lsquo;<samp>&gt;&gt;</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>The red component is obtained by performing a bitwise AND between the
numbers &lsquo;<samp>0xCC6699</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>0xFF0000</samp>&rsquo;. The zeros in &lsquo;<samp>0xFF0000</samp>&rsquo; effectively
“mask” the second and third bytes of &lsquo;<samp>0xCC6699</samp>&rsquo;, causing the &lsquo;<samp>6699</samp>&rsquo; to
be ignored and leaving &lsquo;<samp>0xCC0000</samp>&rsquo; as the result.
</p>
<p>This number is then shifted 16 places to the right (&lsquo;<samp>&gt;&gt; 16</samp>&rsquo;). Each pair
of characters in a hexadecimal number uses 8 bits, so a move 16 places
to the right will convert &lsquo;<samp>0xCC0000</samp>&rsquo; into &lsquo;<samp>0x0000CC</samp>&rsquo;. This is the same
as &lsquo;<samp>0xCC</samp>&rsquo;, which has a decimal value of &lsquo;<samp>204</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the green component is obtained by performing a bitwise AND
between the numbers &lsquo;<samp>0xCC6699</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>0x00FF00</samp>&rsquo;, which gives an output
value of &lsquo;<samp>0x006600</samp>&rsquo;. This output value is then shifted eight places to
the right, giving a value of &lsquo;<samp>0x66</samp>&rsquo;, which has a decimal value of &lsquo;<samp>102</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Finally, the blue component is obtained by performing a bitwise AND
between the numbers &lsquo;<samp>0xCC6699</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>0x0000FF</samp>&rsquo;, which gives an output
value of &lsquo;<samp>0x000099</samp>&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s no need to shift this to the right, as
&lsquo;<samp>0x000099</samp>&rsquo; already equals &lsquo;<samp>0x99</samp>&rsquo;, which has a decimal value of &lsquo;<samp>153</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</li><li> Shifting Behavior for Signed Integers


<p>The shifting behavior is more complex for signed integers than for
unsigned integers, because of the way signed integers are represented in
binary. (The examples below are based on 8-bit signed integers for
simplicity, but the same principles apply for signed integers of any
size.)
</p>
<p>Signed integers use their first bit (known as the <em>sign bit</em>) to
indicate whether the integer is positive or negative. A sign bit of &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo;
means positive, and a sign bit of &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; means negative.
</p>
<p>The remaining bits (known as the <em>value bits</em>) store the actual value.
Positive numbers are stored in exactly the same way as for unsigned
integers, counting upwards from &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s how the bits inside an
&lsquo;<samp>Int8</samp>&rsquo; look for the number &lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<img src="_images/bitshiftSignedFour_2x.png" alt="_images/bitshiftSignedFour_2x">
<p>The sign bit is &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo; (meaning “positive”), and the seven value bits are
just the number &lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo;, written in binary notation.
</p>
<p>Negative numbers, however, are stored differently. They are stored by
subtracting their absolute value from &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo; to the power of &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo;
is the number of value bits. An eight-bit number has seven value bits,
so this means &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo; to the power of &lsquo;<samp>7</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>128</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the bits inside an &lsquo;<samp>Int8</samp>&rsquo; look for the number &lsquo;<samp>-4</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<img src="_images/bitshiftSignedMinusFour_2x.png" alt="_images/bitshiftSignedMinusFour_2x">
<p>This time, the sign bit is &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; (meaning “negative”), and the seven value
bits have a binary value of &lsquo;<samp>124</samp>&rsquo; (which is &lsquo;<samp>128 - 4</samp>&rsquo;):
</p>
<img src="_images/bitshiftSignedMinusFourValue_2x.png" alt="_images/bitshiftSignedMinusFourValue_2x">
<p>This encoding for negative numbers is known as a <em>two&rsquo;s complement</em>
representation. It may seem an unusual way to represent negative
numbers, but it has several advantages.
</p>
<p>First, you can add &lsquo;<samp>-1</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>-4</samp>&rsquo;, simply by performing a standard binary
addition of all eight bits (including the sign bit), and discarding
anything that doesn&rsquo;t fit in the eight bits once you&rsquo;re done:
</p>
<img src="_images/bitshiftSignedAddition_2x.png" alt="_images/bitshiftSignedAddition_2x">
<p>Second, the two&rsquo;s complement representation also lets you shift the bits
of negative numbers to the left and right like positive numbers, and
still end up doubling them for every shift you make to the left, or
halving them for every shift you make to the right. To achieve this, an
extra rule is used when signed integers are shifted to the right: When
you shift signed integers to the right, apply the same rules as for
unsigned integers, but fill any empty bits on the left with the <em>sign
bit</em>, rather than with a zero.
</p>
<img src="_images/bitshiftSigned_2x.png" alt="_images/bitshiftSigned_2x">
<p>This action ensures that signed integers have the same sign after they
are shifted to the right, and is known as an <em>arithmetic shift</em>.
</p>
<p>Because of the special way that positive and negative numbers are
stored, shifting either of them to the right moves them closer to zero.
Keeping the sign bit the same during this shift means that negative
integers remain negative as their value moves closer to zero.
