<span id="While-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">10.2.1 While</h4>

<span id="index-while"></span>

<p>A &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; loop starts by evaluating a single condition. If the condition
is &lsquo;<samp>true</samp>&rsquo;, a set of statements is repeated until the condition becomes
&lsquo;<samp>false</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the general form of a &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; loop:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">while condition {
    statements
}
</pre></div>

<p>This example plays a simple game of <em>Snakes and Ladders</em> (also known as
<em>Chutes and Ladders</em>):
</p>
<img src="images/snakesAndLadders_2x.png" alt="images/snakesAndLadders_2x">
<p>The rules of the game are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The board has 25 squares, and the aim is to land on or beyond square

</li><li> The player&rsquo;s starting square is “square zero”, which is just off the
bottom-left corner of the board.

</li><li> Each turn, you roll a six-sided dice and move by that number of
squares, following the horizontal path indicated by the dotted arrow
above.

</li><li> If your turn ends at the bottom of a ladder, you move up that ladder.

</li><li> If your turn ends at the head of a snake, you move down that snake.
</li></ul>

<p>The game board is represented by an array of &lsquo;<samp>Int</samp>&rsquo; values. Its size is
based on a constant called &lsquo;<samp>finalSquare</samp>&rsquo;, which is used to initialize
the array and also to check for a win condition later in the example.
Because the players start off the board, on “square zero”, the board is
initialized with 26 zero &lsquo;<samp>Int</samp>&rsquo; values, not 25.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
</pre></div>

<p>Some squares are then set to have more specific values for the snakes
and ladders. Squares with a ladder base have a positive number to move
you up the board, whereas squares with a snake head have a negative
number to move you back down the board.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
</pre></div>

<p>Square 3 contains the bottom of a ladder that moves you up to square 11.
To represent this, &lsquo;<samp>board[03]</samp>&rsquo; is equal to &lsquo;<samp>+08</samp>&rsquo;, which is equivalent to
an integer value of &lsquo;<samp>8</samp>&rsquo; (the difference between &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>11</samp>&rsquo;). To align
the values and statements, the unary plus operator (&lsquo;<samp>+i</samp>&rsquo;) is explicitly
used with the unary minus operator (&lsquo;<samp>-i</samp>&rsquo;) and numbers lower than &lsquo;<samp>10</samp>&rsquo;
are padded with zeros. (Neither stylistic technique is strictly
necessary, but they lead to neater code.)
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
while square &lt; finalSquare {
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
    if square &lt; board.count {
        // if we're still on the board, move up or down for a snake or a ladder
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print(&quot;Game over!&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>The example above uses a very simple approach to dice rolling. Instead
of generating a random number, it starts with a &lsquo;<samp>diceRoll</samp>&rsquo; value of &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo;.
Each time through the &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; loop, &lsquo;<samp>diceRoll</samp>&rsquo; is incremented by one and
is then checked to see whether it has become too large. Whenever this
return value equals &lsquo;<samp>7</samp>&rsquo;, the dice roll has become too large and is reset
to a value of &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo;. The result is a sequence of &lsquo;<samp>diceRoll</samp>&rsquo; values that is
always &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>6</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo; and so on.
</p>
<p>After rolling the dice, the player moves forward by &lsquo;<samp>diceRoll</samp>&rsquo; squares.
It&rsquo;s possible that the dice roll may have moved the player beyond square
25, in which case the game is over. To cope with this scenario, the code
checks that &lsquo;<samp>square</samp>&rsquo; is less than the &lsquo;<samp>board</samp>&rsquo; array&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>count</samp>&rsquo; property.
If &lsquo;<samp>square</samp>&rsquo; is valid, the value stored in &lsquo;<samp>board[square]</samp>&rsquo; is added to
the current &lsquo;<samp>square</samp>&rsquo; value to move the player up or down any ladders or
snakes.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>If this check is not performed, &lsquo;<samp>board[square]</samp>&rsquo; might try to access a
value outside the bounds of the &lsquo;<samp>board</samp>&rsquo; array, which would trigger a
runtime error.
</p>
<p>The current &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; loop execution then ends, and the loop&rsquo;s condition
is checked to see if the loop should be executed again. If the player
has moved on or beyond square number &lsquo;<samp>25</samp>&rsquo;, the loop&rsquo;s condition
evaluates to &lsquo;<samp>false</samp>&rsquo; and the game ends.
</p>
<p>A &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; loop is appropriate in this case, because the length of the
game is not clear at the start of the &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; loop. Instead, the loop is
executed until a particular condition is satisfied.
