<span id="Delegation-1"></span><h3 class="section">26.7 Delegation</h3>

<p><em>Delegation</em> is a design pattern that enables a class or structure to
hand off (or <em>delegate</em>) some of its responsibilities to an instance of
another type. This design pattern is implemented by defining a protocol
that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities, such that a conforming
type (known as a delegate) is guaranteed to provide the functionality
that has been delegated. Delegation can be used to respond to a
particular action, or to retrieve data from an external source without
needing to know the underlying type of that source.
</p>
<p>The example below defines two protocols for use with dice-based board
games:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">protocol DiceGame {
    var dice: Dice { get }
    func play()
}
protocol DiceGameDelegate: AnyObject {
    func gameDidStart(_ game: DiceGame)
    func game(_ game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int)
    func gameDidEnd(_ game: DiceGame)
}
</pre></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo; protocol is a protocol that can be adopted by any game
that involves dice.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo; protocol can be adopted to track the progress of
a &lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo;. To prevent strong reference cycles, delegates are declared
as weak references. For information about weak references, see
<a href="Strong-Reference-Cycles-Between-Class-Instances.html#Strong-Reference-Cycles-Between-Class-Instances">Strong Reference Cycles
Between Class Instances</a>. Marking the protocol as class-only lets the
&lsquo;<samp>SnakesAndLadders</samp>&rsquo; class later in this chapter declare that its delegate
must use a weak reference. A class-only protocol is marked by its
inheritance from &lsquo;<samp>AnyObject</samp>&rsquo; as discussed in
<a href="Class_002dOnly-Protocols.html#Class_002dOnly-Protocols">Class-Only Protocols</a>.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a version of the <em>Snakes and Ladders</em> game originally introduced
in <a href="Control-Flow.html#Control-Flow">Control Flow</a>. This version is adapted to use
a &lsquo;<samp>Dice</samp>&rsquo; instance for its dice-rolls; to adopt the &lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo; protocol;
and to notify a &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo; about its progress:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class SnakesAndLadders: DiceGame {
    let finalSquare = 25
    let dice = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
    var square = 0
    var board: [Int]
    init() {
        board = Array(repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
        board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
        board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
    }
    weak var delegate: DiceGameDelegate?
    func play() {
        square = 0
        delegate?.gameDidStart(self)
        gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
            let diceRoll = dice.roll()
            delegate?.game(self, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll: diceRoll)
            switch square + diceRoll {
            case finalSquare:
                break gameLoop
            case let newSquare where newSquare &gt; finalSquare:
                continue gameLoop
            default:
                square += diceRoll
                square += board[square]
            }
        }
        delegate?.gameDidEnd(self)
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>For a description of the <em>Snakes and Ladders</em> gameplay, see
<a href="Break.html#Break">Break</a>.
</p>
<p>This version of the game is wrapped up as a class called
&lsquo;<samp>SnakesAndLadders</samp>&rsquo;, which adopts the &lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo; protocol. It provides a
gettable &lsquo;<samp>dice</samp>&rsquo; property and a &lsquo;<samp>play()</samp>&rsquo; method in order to conform to
the protocol. (The &lsquo;<samp>dice</samp>&rsquo; property is declared as a constant property
because it doesn&rsquo;t need to change after initialization, and the protocol
only requires that it must be gettable.)
</p>
<p>The <em>Snakes and Ladders</em> game board setup takes place within the class&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<samp>init()</samp>&rsquo; initializer. All game logic is moved into the protocol&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>play</samp>&rsquo;
method, which uses the protocol&rsquo;s required &lsquo;<samp>dice</samp>&rsquo; property to provide
its dice roll values.
</p>
<p>Note that the &lsquo;<samp>delegate</samp>&rsquo; property is defined as an <em>optional</em>
&lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo;, because a delegate isn&rsquo;t required in order to play
the game. Because it&rsquo;s of an optional type, the &lsquo;<samp>delegate</samp>&rsquo; property is
automatically set to an initial value of &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;. Thereafter, the game
instantiator has the option to set the property to a suitable delegate.
Because the &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo; protocol is class-only, you can declare
the delegate to be &lsquo;<samp>weak</samp>&rsquo; to prevent reference cycles.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo; provides three methods for tracking the progress of a
game. These three methods have been incorporated into the game logic
within the &lsquo;<samp>play()</samp>&rsquo; method above, and are called when a new game starts,
a new turn begins, or the game ends.
</p>
<p>Because the &lsquo;<samp>delegate</samp>&rsquo; property is an <em>optional</em> &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo;, the
&lsquo;<samp>play()</samp>&rsquo; method uses optional chaining each time it calls a method on
the delegate. If the &lsquo;<samp>delegate</samp>&rsquo; property is nil, these delegate calls
fail gracefully and without error. If the &lsquo;<samp>delegate</samp>&rsquo; property is
non-nil, the delegate methods are called, and are passed the
&lsquo;<samp>SnakesAndLadders</samp>&rsquo; instance as a parameter.
</p>
<p>This next example shows a class called &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameTracker</samp>&rsquo;, which adopts
the &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo; protocol:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class DiceGameTracker: DiceGameDelegate {
    var numberOfTurns = 0
    func gameDidStart(_ game: DiceGame) {
        numberOfTurns = 0
        if game is SnakesAndLadders {
            print(&quot;Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders&quot;)
        }
        print(&quot;The game is using a \(game.dice.sides)-sided dice&quot;)
    }
    func game(_ game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int) {
        numberOfTurns += 1
        print(&quot;Rolled a \(diceRoll)&quot;)
    }
    func gameDidEnd(_ game: DiceGame) {
        print(&quot;The game lasted for \(numberOfTurns) turns&quot;)
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>&lsquo;<samp>DiceGameTracker</samp>&rsquo; implements all three methods required by
&lsquo;<samp>DiceGameDelegate</samp>&rsquo;. It uses these methods to keep track of the number of
turns a game has taken. It resets a &lsquo;<samp>numberOfTurns</samp>&rsquo; property to zero
when the game starts, increments it each time a new turn begins, and
prints out the total number of turns once the game has ended.
</p>
<p>The implementation of &lsquo;<samp>gameDidStart(_:)</samp>&rsquo; shown above uses the &lsquo;<samp>game</samp>&rsquo;
parameter to print some introductory information about the game that is
about to be played. The &lsquo;<samp>game</samp>&rsquo; parameter has a type of &lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo;, not
&lsquo;<samp>SnakesAndLadders</samp>&rsquo;, and so &lsquo;<samp>gameDidStart(_:)</samp>&rsquo; can access and use only
methods and properties that are implemented as part of the &lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo;
protocol. However, the method is still able to use type casting to query
the type of the underlying instance. In this example, it checks whether
&lsquo;<samp>game</samp>&rsquo; is actually an instance of &lsquo;<samp>SnakesAndLadders</samp>&rsquo; behind the scenes,
and prints an appropriate message if so.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>gameDidStart(_:)</samp>&rsquo; method also accesses the &lsquo;<samp>dice</samp>&rsquo; property of the
passed &lsquo;<samp>game</samp>&rsquo; parameter. Because &lsquo;<samp>game</samp>&rsquo; is known to conform to the
&lsquo;<samp>DiceGame</samp>&rsquo; protocol, it&rsquo;s guaranteed to have a &lsquo;<samp>dice</samp>&rsquo; property, and so
the &lsquo;<samp>gameDidStart(_:)</samp>&rsquo; method is able to access and print the dice&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<samp>sides</samp>&rsquo; property, regardless of what kind of game is being played.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how &lsquo;<samp>DiceGameTracker</samp>&rsquo; looks in action:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let tracker = DiceGameTracker()
let game = SnakesAndLadders()
game.delegate = tracker
game.play()
// Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders
// The game is using a 6-sided dice
// Rolled a 3
// Rolled a 5
// Rolled a 4
// Rolled a 5
// The game lasted for 4 turns
</pre></div>
