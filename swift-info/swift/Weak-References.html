<span id="Weak-References-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">29.4.1 Weak References</h4>

<span id="index-weak"></span>

<p>A <em>weak reference</em> is a reference that does not keep a strong hold on
the instance it refers to, and so does not stop ARC from disposing of
the referenced instance. This behavior prevents the reference from
becoming part of a strong reference cycle. You indicate a weak reference
by placing the &lsquo;<samp>weak</samp>&rsquo; keyword before a property or variable declaration.
</p>
<p>Because a weak reference does not keep a strong hold on the instance it
refers to, it&rsquo;s possible for that instance to be deallocated while the
weak reference is still referring to it. Therefore, ARC automatically
sets a weak reference to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; when the instance that it refers to is
deallocated. And, because weak references need to allow their value to
be changed to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; at runtime, they are always declared as variables,
rather than constants, of an optional type.
</p>
<p>You can check for the existence of a value in the weak reference, just
like any other optional value, and you will never end up with a
reference to an invalid instance that no longer exists.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>Property observers aren&rsquo;t called when ARC sets a weak reference to
&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The example below is identical to the &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; example
from above, with one important difference. This time around, the
&lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; type&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>tenant</samp>&rsquo; property is declared as a weak reference:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Person {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
    var apartment: Apartment?
    deinit { print(&quot;\(name) is being deinitialized&quot;) }
}

class Apartment {
    let unit: String
    init(unit: String) { self.unit = unit }
    weak var tenant: Person?
    deinit { print(&quot;Apartment \(unit) is being deinitialized&quot;) }
}
</pre></div>

<p>The strong references from the two variables (&lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo;) and
the links between the two instances are created as before:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var john: Person?
var unit4A: Apartment?

john = Person(name: &quot;John Appleseed&quot;)
unit4A = Apartment(unit: &quot;4A&quot;)

john!.apartment = unit4A
unit4A!.tenant = john
</pre></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the references look now that you&rsquo;ve linked the two instances
together:
</p>
<img src="_images/weakReference01_2x.png" alt="_images/weakReference01_2x">
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance still has a strong reference to the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo;
instance, but the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance now has a <em>weak</em> reference to the
&lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance. This means that when you break the strong reference
held by the &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; variable by setting it to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, there are no more
strong references to the &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">john = nil
// Prints &quot;John Appleseed is being deinitialized&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Because there are no more strong references to the &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance,
it&rsquo;s deallocated and the &lsquo;<samp>tenant</samp>&rsquo; property is set to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<img src="_images/weakReference02_2x.png" alt="_images/weakReference02_2x">
<p>The only remaining strong reference to the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance is from
the &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo; variable. If you break <em>that</em> strong reference, there are
no more strong references to the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">unit4A = nil
// Prints &quot;Apartment 4A is being deinitialized&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Because there are no more strong references to the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance,
it too is deallocated:
</p>
<img src="_images/weakReference03_2x.png" alt="_images/weakReference03_2x">

<p>Note
</p>
<p>In systems that use garbage collection, weak pointers are sometimes used
to implement a simple caching mechanism because objects with no strong
references are deallocated only when memory pressure triggers garbage
collection. However, with ARC, values are deallocated as soon as their
last strong reference is removed, making weak references unsuitable for
such a purpose.
