<span id="Initializer-Delegation-for-Value-Types-1"></span><h3 class="section">19.4 Initializer Delegation for Value Types</h3>

<p>Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an
instance&rsquo;s initialization. This process, known as <em>initializer
delegation</em>, avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers.
</p>
<p>The rules for how initializer delegation works, and for what forms of
delegation are allowed, are different for value types and class types.
Value types (structures and enumerations) do not support inheritance,
and so their initializer delegation process is relatively simple,
because they can only delegate to another initializer that they provide
themselves. Classes, however, can inherit from other classes, as
described in <a href="Inheritance.html#Inheritance">Inheritance</a>. This means that
classes have additional responsibilities for ensuring that all stored
properties they inherit are assigned a suitable value during
initialization. These responsibilities are described in
<a href="Class-Inheritance-and-Initialization.html#Class-Inheritance-and-Initialization">Class Inheritance and Initialization</a>
below.
</p>
<p>For value types, you use &lsquo;<samp>self.init</samp>&rsquo; to refer to other initializers from
the same value type when writing your own custom initializers. You can
call &lsquo;<samp>self.init</samp>&rsquo; only from within an initializer.
</p>
<p>Note that if you define a custom initializer for a value type, you will
no longer have access to the default initializer (or the memberwise
initializer, if it is a structure) for that type. This constraint
prevents a situation in which additional essential setup provided in a
more complex initializer is accidentally circumvented by someone using
one of the automatic initializers.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>If you want your custom value type to be initializable with the default
initializer and memberwise initializer, and also with your own custom
initializers, write your custom initializers in an extension rather than
as part of the value type&rsquo;s original implementation. For more
information, see <a href="Extensions.html#Extensions">Extensions</a>.
</p>
<p>The following example defines a custom &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo; structure to represent a
geometric rectangle. The example requires two supporting structures
called &lsquo;<samp>Size</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Point</samp>&rsquo;, both of which provide default values of &lsquo;<samp>0.0</samp>&rsquo;
for all of their properties:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct Size {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}
</pre></div>

<p>You can initialize the &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo; structure below in one of three ways&mdash;by
using its default zero-initialized &lsquo;<samp>origin</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>size</samp>&rsquo; property values,
by providing a specific origin point and size, or by providing a
specific center point and size. These initialization options are
represented by three custom initializers that are part of the &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo;
structure&rsquo;s definition:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    init() {}
    init(origin: Point, size: Size) {
        self.origin = origin
        self.size = size
    }
    init(center: Point, size: Size) {
        let originX = center.x - (size.width / 2)
        let originY = center.y - (size.height / 2)
        self.init(origin: Point(x: originX, y: originY), size: size)
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>The first &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo; initializer, &lsquo;<samp>init()</samp>&rsquo;, is functionally the same as the
default initializer that the structure would have received if it did not
have its own custom initializers. This initializer has an empty body,
represented by an empty pair of curly braces &lsquo;<samp>{}</samp>&rsquo;. Calling this
initializer returns a &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo; instance whose &lsquo;<samp>origin</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>size</samp>&rsquo;
properties are both initialized with the default values of
&lsquo;<samp>Point(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Size(width: 0.0, height: 0.0)</samp>&rsquo; from their
property definitions:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let basicRect = Rect()
// basicRect's origin is (0.0, 0.0) and its size is (0.0, 0.0)
</pre></div>

<p>The second &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo; initializer, &lsquo;<samp>init(origin:size:)</samp>&rsquo;, is functionally the
same as the memberwise initializer that the structure would have
received if it did not have its own custom initializers. This
initializer simply assigns the &lsquo;<samp>origin</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>size</samp>&rsquo; argument values to
the appropriate stored properties:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let originRect = Rect(origin: Point(x: 2.0, y: 2.0),
                      size: Size(width: 5.0, height: 5.0))
// originRect's origin is (2.0, 2.0) and its size is (5.0, 5.0)
</pre></div>

<p>The third &lsquo;<samp>Rect</samp>&rsquo; initializer, &lsquo;<samp>init(center:size:)</samp>&rsquo;, is slightly more
complex. It starts by calculating an appropriate origin point based on a
&lsquo;<samp>center</samp>&rsquo; point and a &lsquo;<samp>size</samp>&rsquo; value. It then calls (or <em>delegates</em>) to the
&lsquo;<samp>init(origin:size:)</samp>&rsquo; initializer, which stores the new origin and size
values in the appropriate properties:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let centerRect = Rect(center: Point(x: 4.0, y: 4.0), size: Size(width: 3.0, height: 3.0))
// centerRect's origin is (2.5, 2.5) and its size is (3.0, 3.0)
</pre></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>init(center:size:)</samp>&rsquo; initializer could have assigned the new values
of &lsquo;<samp>origin</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>size</samp>&rsquo; to the appropriate properties itself. However, it
is more convenient (and clearer in intent) for the &lsquo;<samp>init(center:size:)</samp>&rsquo;
initializer to take advantage of an existing initializer that already
provides exactly that functionality.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>For an alternative way to write this example without defining the
&lsquo;<samp>init()</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>init(origin:size:)</samp>&rsquo; initializers yourself, see
<a href="Extensions.html#Extensions">Extensions</a>.
