<span id="index-unowned"></span>

<p>Like a weak reference, an <em>unowned reference</em> does not keep a strong
hold on the instance it refers to. Unlike a weak reference, however, an
unowned reference is used when the other instance has the same lifetime
or a longer lifetime. You indicate an unowned reference by placing the
&lsquo;<samp>unowned</samp>&rsquo; keyword before a property or variable declaration.
</p>
<p>An unowned reference is expected to always have a value. As a result,
ARC never sets an unowned reference&rsquo;s value to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, which means that
unowned references are defined using non-optional types.
</p>
<p>Important
</p>
<p>Use an unowned reference only when you are sure that the reference
<em>always</em> refers to an instance that has not been deallocated.
</p>
<p>If you try to access the value of an unowned reference after that
instance has been deallocated, you&rsquo;ll get a runtime error.
</p>
<p>The following example defines two classes, &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo;,
which model a bank customer and a possible credit card for that
customer. These two classes each store an instance of the other class as
a property. This relationship has the potential to create a strong
reference cycle.
</p>
<p>The relationship between &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; is slightly
different from the relationship between &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; seen in
the weak reference example above. In this data model, a customer may or
may not have a credit card, but a credit card will <em>always</em> be
associated with a customer. A &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance never outlives the
&lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; that it refers to. To represent this, the &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; class
has an optional &lsquo;<samp>card</samp>&rsquo; property, but the &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; class has an
unowned (and non-optional) &lsquo;<samp>customer</samp>&rsquo; property.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, a new &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance can <em>only</em> be created by
passing a &lsquo;<samp>number</samp>&rsquo; value and a &lsquo;<samp>customer</samp>&rsquo; instance to a custom
&lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; initializer. This ensures that a &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance
always has a &lsquo;<samp>customer</samp>&rsquo; instance associated with it when the
&lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance is created.
</p>
<p>Because a credit card will always have a customer, you define its
&lsquo;<samp>customer</samp>&rsquo; property as an unowned reference, to avoid a strong reference
cycle:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Customer {
    let name: String
    var card: CreditCard?
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    deinit { print(&quot;\(name) is being deinitialized&quot;) }
}

class CreditCard {
    let number: UInt64
    unowned let customer: Customer
    init(number: UInt64, customer: Customer) {
        self.number = number
        self.customer = customer
    }
    deinit { print(&quot;Card #\(number) is being deinitialized&quot;) }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Note
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>number</samp>&rsquo; property of the &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; class is defined with a type
of &lsquo;<samp>UInt64</samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp>Int</samp>&rsquo;, to ensure that the &lsquo;<samp>number</samp>&rsquo; property&rsquo;s
capacity is large enough to store a 16-digit card number on both 32-bit
and 64-bit systems.
</p>
<p>This next code snippet defines an optional &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; variable called
&lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo;, which will be used to store a reference to a specific customer.
This variable has an initial value of nil, by virtue of being optional:
</p>
<ol>
<li> var john: Customer?
</li></ol>

<p>You can now create a &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; instance, and use it to initialize and
assign a new &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance as that customer&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>card</samp>&rsquo; property:
</p>
<ol>
<li> john = Customer(name: &quot;John Appleseed&quot;)
</li><li> john!.card = CreditCard(number: 1234<em>_5678</em><em>_9012</em><em>_3456</em>, customer: john!)
</li></ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the references look, now that you&rsquo;ve linked the two
instances:
</p>
<img src="_images/unownedReference01_2x.png" alt="_images/unownedReference01_2x">
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; instance now has a strong reference to the &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo;
instance, and the &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance has an unowned reference to the
&lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; instance.
</p>
<p>Because of the unowned &lsquo;<samp>customer</samp>&rsquo; reference, when you break the strong
reference held by the &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; variable, there are no more strong
references to the &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; instance:
</p>
<img src="_images/unownedReference02_2x.png" alt="_images/unownedReference02_2x">
<p>Because there are no more strong references to the &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; instance,
it&rsquo;s deallocated. After this happens, there are no more strong
references to the &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance, and it too is deallocated:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">john = nil
// Prints &quot;John Appleseed is being deinitialized&quot;
// Prints &quot;Card #1234567890123456 is being deinitialized&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The final code snippet above shows that the deinitializers for the
&lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; instance and &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; instance both print their
“deinitialized” messages after the &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; variable is set to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>The examples above show how to use <em>safe</em> unowned references. Swift also
provides <em>unsafe</em> unowned references for cases where you need to disable
runtime safety checks&mdash;for example, for performance reasons. As with
all unsafe operations, you take on the responsibility for checking that
code for safety.
</p>
<p>You indicate an unsafe unowned reference by writing &lsquo;<samp>unowned(unsafe)</samp>&rsquo;.
If you try to access an unsafe unowned reference after the instance that
it refers to is deallocated, your program will try to access the memory
location where the instance used to be, which is an unsafe operation.
