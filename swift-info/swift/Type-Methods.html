<span id="Type-Methods-1"></span><h3 class="section">16.2 Type Methods</h3>

<p>Instance methods, as described above, are methods that you call on an
instance of a particular type. You can also define methods that are
called on the type itself. These kinds of methods are called <em>type
methods</em>. You indicate type methods by writing the &lsquo;<samp>static</samp>&rsquo; keyword
before the method&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>func</samp>&rsquo; keyword. Classes can use the &lsquo;<samp>class</samp>&rsquo; keyword
instead, to allow subclasses to override the superclass&rsquo;s implementation
of that method.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>In Objective-C, you can define type-level methods only for Objective-C
classes. In Swift, you can define type-level methods for all classes,
structures, and enumerations. Each type method is explicitly scoped to
the type it supports.
</p>
<p>Type methods are called with dot syntax, like instance methods. However,
you call type methods on the type, not on an instance of that type.
Here&rsquo;s how you call a type method on a class called &lsquo;<samp>SomeClass</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class SomeClass {
    class func someTypeMethod() {
        // type method implementation goes here
    }
}
SomeClass.someTypeMethod()
</pre></div>

<p>Within the body of a type method, the implicit &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; property refers to
the type itself, rather than an instance of that type. This means that
you can use &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; to disambiguate between type properties and type
method parameters, just as you do for instance properties and instance
method parameters.
</p>
<p>More generally, any unqualified method and property names that you use
within the body of a type method will refer to other type-level methods
and properties. A type method can call another type method with the
other method&rsquo;s name, without needing to prefix it with the type name.
Similarly, type methods on structures and enumerations can access type
properties by using the type property&rsquo;s name without a type name prefix.
</p>
<p>The example below defines a structure called &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo;, which
tracks a player&rsquo;s progress through the different levels or stages of a
game. It is a single-player game, but can store information for multiple
players on a single device.
</p>
<p>All of the game&rsquo;s levels (apart from level one) are locked when the game
is first played. Every time a player finishes a level, that level is
unlocked for all players on the device. The &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; structure
uses type properties and methods to keep track of which levels of the
game have been unlocked. It also tracks the current level for an
individual player.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct LevelTracker {
    static var highestUnlockedLevel = 1
    var currentLevel = 1

    static func unlock(_ level: Int) {
        if level &gt; highestUnlockedLevel { highestUnlockedLevel = level }
    }

    static func isUnlocked(_ level: Int) -&gt; Bool {
        return level &lt;= highestUnlockedLevel
    }

    @discardableResult
    mutating func advance(to level: Int) -&gt; Bool {
        if LevelTracker.isUnlocked(level) {
            currentLevel = level
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; structure keeps track of the highest level that any
player has unlocked. This value is stored in a type property called
&lsquo;<samp>highestUnlockedLevel</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; also defines two type functions to work with the
&lsquo;<samp>highestUnlockedLevel</samp>&rsquo; property. The first is a type function called
&lsquo;<samp>unlock(_:)</samp>&rsquo;, which updates the value of &lsquo;<samp>highestUnlockedLevel</samp>&rsquo; whenever
a new level is unlocked. The second is a convenience type function
called &lsquo;<samp>isUnlocked(_:)</samp>&rsquo;, which returns &lsquo;<samp>true</samp>&rsquo; if a particular level
number is already unlocked. (Note that these type methods can access the
&lsquo;<samp>highestUnlockedLevel</samp>&rsquo; type property without your needing to write it as
&lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker.highestUnlockedLevel</samp>&rsquo;.)
</p>
<p>In addition to its type property and type methods, &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; tracks
an individual player&rsquo;s progress through the game. It uses an instance
property called &lsquo;<samp>currentLevel</samp>&rsquo; to track the level that a player is
currently playing.
</p>
<p>To help manage the &lsquo;<samp>currentLevel</samp>&rsquo; property, &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; defines an
instance method called &lsquo;<samp>advance(to:)</samp>&rsquo;. Before updating &lsquo;<samp>currentLevel</samp>&rsquo;,
this method checks whether the requested new level is already unlocked.
The &lsquo;<samp>advance(to:)</samp>&rsquo; method returns a Boolean value to indicate whether or
not it was actually able to set &lsquo;<samp>currentLevel</samp>&rsquo;. Because it&rsquo;s not
necessarily a mistake for code that calls the &lsquo;<samp>advance(to:)</samp>&rsquo; method to
ignore the return value, this function is marked with the
&lsquo;<samp>@discardableResult</samp>&rsquo; attribute. For more information about this
attribute, see Attributes.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; structure is used with the &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; class, shown
below, to track and update the progress of an individual player:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Player {
    var tracker = LevelTracker()
    let playerName: String
    func complete(level: Int) {
        LevelTracker.unlock(level + 1)
        tracker.advance(to: level + 1)
    }
    init(name: String) {
        playerName = name
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; class creates a new instance of &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker</samp>&rsquo; to track
that player&rsquo;s progress. It also provides a method called
&lsquo;<samp>complete(level:)</samp>&rsquo;, which is called whenever a player completes a
particular level. This method unlocks the next level for all players and
updates the player&rsquo;s progress to move them to the next level. (The
Boolean return value of &lsquo;<samp>advance(to:)</samp>&rsquo; is ignored, because the level is
known to have been unlocked by the call to &lsquo;<samp>LevelTracker.unlock(_:)</samp>&rsquo; on
the previous line.)
</p>
<p>You can create an instance of the &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; class for a new player, and
see what happens when the player completes level one:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var player = Player(name: &quot;Argyrios&quot;)
player.complete(level: 1)
print(&quot;highest unlocked level is now \(LevelTracker.highestUnlockedLevel)&quot;)
// Prints &quot;highest unlocked level is now 2&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>If you create a second player, whom you try to move to a level that is
not yet unlocked by any player in the game, the attempt to set the
player&rsquo;s current level fails:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">player = Player(name: &quot;Beto&quot;)
if player.tracker.advance(to: 6) {
    print(&quot;player is now on level 6&quot;)
} else {
    print(&quot;level 6 has not yet been unlocked&quot;)
}
// Prints &quot;level 6 has not yet been unlocked&quot;
</pre></div>
