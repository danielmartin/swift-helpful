<span id="Deinitializers-in-Action-1"></span><h3 class="section">20.2 Deinitializers in Action</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a deinitializer in action. This example defines two
new types, &lsquo;<samp>Bank</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo;, for a simple game. The &lsquo;<samp>Bank</samp>&rsquo; class
manages a made-up currency, which can never have more than 10,000 coins
in circulation. There can only ever be one &lsquo;<samp>Bank</samp>&rsquo; in the game, and so
the &lsquo;<samp>Bank</samp>&rsquo; is implemented as a class with type properties and methods to
store and manage its current state:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Bank {
    static var coinsInBank = 10_000
    static func distribute(coins numberOfCoinsRequested: Int) -&gt; Int {
        let numberOfCoinsToVend = min(numberOfCoinsRequested, coinsInBank)
        coinsInBank -= numberOfCoinsToVend
        return numberOfCoinsToVend
    }
    static func receive(coins: Int) {
        coinsInBank += coins
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>&lsquo;<samp>Bank</samp>&rsquo; keeps track of the current number of coins it holds with its
&lsquo;<samp>coinsInBank</samp>&rsquo; property. It also offers two
methods&mdash;&lsquo;<samp>distribute(coins:)</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>receive(coins:)</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;to handle the
distribution and collection of coins.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>distribute(coins:)</samp>&rsquo; method checks that there are enough coins in
the bank before distributing them. If there are not enough coins, &lsquo;<samp>Bank</samp>&rsquo;
returns a smaller number than the number that was requested (and returns
zero if no coins are left in the bank). It returns an integer value to
indicate the actual number of coins that were provided.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>receive(coins:)</samp>&rsquo; method simply adds the received number of coins
back into the bank&rsquo;s coin store.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; class describes a player in the game. Each player has a
certain number of coins stored in their purse at any time. This is
represented by the player&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>coinsInPurse</samp>&rsquo; property:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Player {
    var coinsInPurse: Int
    init(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse = Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    func win(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse += Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    deinit {
        Bank.receive(coins: coinsInPurse)
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Each &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance is initialized with a starting allowance of a
specified number of coins from the bank during initialization, although
a &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance may receive fewer than that number if not enough
coins are available.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; class defines a &lsquo;<samp>win(coins:)</samp>&rsquo; method, which retrieves a
certain number of coins from the bank and adds them to the player&rsquo;s
purse. The &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; class also implements a deinitializer, which is
called just before a &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance is deallocated. Here, the
deinitializer simply returns all of the player&rsquo;s coins to the bank:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var playerOne: Player? = Player(coins: 100)
print(&quot;A new player has joined the game with \(playerOne!.coinsInPurse) coins&quot;)
// Prints &quot;A new player has joined the game with 100 coins&quot;
print(&quot;There are now \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins left in the bank&quot;)
// Prints &quot;There are now 9900 coins left in the bank&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>A new &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance is created, with a request for 100 coins if they
are available. This &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance is stored in an optional &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo;
variable called &lsquo;<samp>playerOne</samp>&rsquo;. An optional variable is used here, because
players can leave the game at any point. The optional lets you track
whether there is currently a player in the game.
</p>
<p>Because &lsquo;<samp>playerOne</samp>&rsquo; is an optional, it is qualified with an exclamation
mark (&lsquo;<samp>!</samp>&rsquo;) when its &lsquo;<samp>coinsInPurse</samp>&rsquo; property is accessed to print its
default number of coins, and whenever its &lsquo;<samp>win(coins:)</samp>&rsquo; method is
called:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">playerOne!.win(coins: 2_000)
print(&quot;PlayerOne won 2000 coins &amp; now has \(playerOne!.coinsInPurse) coins&quot;)
// Prints &quot;PlayerOne won 2000 coins &amp; now has 2100 coins&quot;
print(&quot;The bank now only has \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins left&quot;)
// Prints &quot;The bank now only has 7900 coins left&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Here, the player has won 2,000 coins. The player&rsquo;s purse now contains
2,100 coins, and the bank has only 7,900 coins left.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">playerOne = nil
print(&quot;PlayerOne has left the game&quot;)
// Prints &quot;PlayerOne has left the game&quot;
print(&quot;The bank now has \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins&quot;)
// Prints &quot;The bank now has 10000 coins&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The player has now left the game. This is indicated by setting the
optional &lsquo;<samp>playerOne</samp>&rsquo; variable to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, meaning “no &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance.”
At the point that this happens, the &lsquo;<samp>playerOne</samp>&rsquo; variable&rsquo;s reference to
the &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance is broken. No other properties or variables are
still referring to the &lsquo;<samp>Player</samp>&rsquo; instance, and so it is deallocated in
order to free up its memory. Just before this happens, its deinitializer
is called automatically, and its coins are returned to the bank.
