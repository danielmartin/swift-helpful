<p>Types like structures, tuples, and enumerations are made up of
individual constituent values, such as the properties of a structure or
the elements of a tuple. Because these are value types, mutating any
piece of the value mutates the whole value, meaning read or write access
to one of the properties requires read or write access to the whole
value. For example, overlapping write accesses to the elements of a
tuple produces a conflict:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var playerInformation = (health: 10, energy: 20)
balance(&amp;playerInformation.health, &amp;playerInformation.energy)
// Error: conflicting access to properties of playerInformation
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, calling &lsquo;<samp>balance(_:_:)</samp>&rsquo; on the elements of a tuple
produces a conflict because there are overlapping write accesses to
&lsquo;<samp>playerInformation</samp>&rsquo;. Both &lsquo;<samp>playerInformation.health</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>playerInformation.energy</samp>&rsquo; are passed as in-out parameters, which means
&lsquo;<samp>balance(_:_:)</samp>&rsquo; needs write access to them for the duration of the
function call. In both cases, a write access to the tuple element
requires a write access to the entire tuple. This means there are two
write accesses to &lsquo;<samp>playerInformation</samp>&rsquo; with durations that overlap,
causing a conflict.
</p>
<p>The code below shows that the same error appears for overlapping write
accesses to the properties of a structure that&rsquo;s stored in a global
variable.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var holly = Player(name: &quot;Holly&quot;, health: 10, energy: 10)
balance(&amp;holly.health, &amp;holly.energy) // Error
</pre></div>

<p>In practice, most access to the properties of a structure can overlap
safely. For example, if the variable &lsquo;<samp>holly</samp>&rsquo; in the example above is
changed to a local variable instead of a global variable, the compiler
can prove that overlapping access to stored properties of the structure
is safe:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">func someFunction() {
    var oscar = Player(name: &quot;Oscar&quot;, health: 10, energy: 10)
    balance(&amp;oscar.health, &amp;oscar.energy) // OK
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, Oscar&rsquo;s health and energy are passed as the two
in-out parameters to &lsquo;<samp>balance(_:_:)</samp>&rsquo;. The compiler can prove that memory
safety is preserved because the two stored properties don&rsquo;t interact in
any way.
</p>
<p>The restriction against overlapping access to properties of a structure
isn&rsquo;t always necessary to preserve memory safety. Memory safety is the
desired guarantee, but exclusive access is a stricter requirement than
memory safety&mdash;which means some code preserves memory safety, even
though it violates exclusive access to memory. Swift allows this
memory-safe code if the compiler can prove that the nonexclusive access
to memory is still safe. Specifically, it can prove that overlapping
access to properties of a structure is safe if the following conditions
apply:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You&rsquo;re accessing only stored properties of an instance, not computed
properties or class properties.

</li><li> The structure is the value of a local variable, not a global variable.

</li><li> The structure is either not captured by any closures, or it&rsquo;s captured
only by nonescaping closures.
</li></ul>

<p>If the compiler can&rsquo;t prove the access is safe, it doesn&rsquo;t allow the
access.
