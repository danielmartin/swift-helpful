<p>You use the &lsquo;<samp>for</samp>&rsquo;-&lsquo;<samp>in</samp>&rsquo; loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in
an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string.
</p>
<p>This example uses a &lsquo;<samp>for</samp>&rsquo;-&lsquo;<samp>in</samp>&rsquo; loop to iterate over the items in an
array:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let names = [&quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Brian&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;]
for name in names {
    print(&quot;Hello, \(name)!&quot;)
}
// Hello, Anna!
// Hello, Alex!
// Hello, Brian!
// Hello, Jack!
</pre></div>

<p>You can also iterate over a dictionary to access its key-value pairs.
Each item in the dictionary is returned as a &lsquo;<samp>(key, value)</samp>&rsquo; tuple when
the dictionary is iterated, and you can decompose the &lsquo;<samp>(key, value)</samp>&rsquo;
tuple&rsquo;s members as explicitly named constants for use within the body of
the &lsquo;<samp>for</samp>&rsquo;-&lsquo;<samp>in</samp>&rsquo; loop. In the code example below, the dictionary&rsquo;s keys
are decomposed into a constant called &lsquo;<samp>animalName</samp>&rsquo;, and the dictionary&rsquo;s
values are decomposed into a constant called &lsquo;<samp>legCount</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let numberOfLegs = [&quot;spider&quot;: 8, &quot;ant&quot;: 6, &quot;cat&quot;: 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print(&quot;\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs&quot;)
}
// cats have 4 legs
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
</pre></div>

<p>The contents of a &lsquo;<samp>Dictionary</samp>&rsquo; are inherently unordered, and iterating
over them does not guarantee the order in which they will be retrieved.
In particular, the order you insert items into a &lsquo;<samp>Dictionary</samp>&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t
define the order they are iterated. For more about arrays and
dictionaries, see <a href="Collection-Types.html#Collection-Types">Collection Types</a>.
</p>
<p>You can also use &lsquo;<samp>for</samp>&rsquo;-&lsquo;<samp>in</samp>&rsquo; loops with numeric ranges. This example
prints the first few entries in a five-times table:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">for index in 1...5 {
    print(&quot;\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)&quot;)
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25
</pre></div>

<p>The sequence being iterated over is a range of numbers from &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo;,
inclusive, as indicated by the use of the closed range operator (&lsquo;<samp>...</samp>&rsquo;).
The value of &lsquo;<samp>index</samp>&rsquo; is set to the first number in the range (&lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo;), and
the statements inside the loop are executed. In this case, the loop
contains only one statement, which prints an entry from the five-times
table for the current value of &lsquo;<samp>index</samp>&rsquo;. After the statement is executed,
the value of &lsquo;<samp>index</samp>&rsquo; is updated to contain the second value in the range
(&lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo;), and the &lsquo;<samp>print(_:separator:terminator:)</samp>&rsquo; function is called
again. This process continues until the end of the range is reached.
</p>
<p>In the example above, &lsquo;<samp>index</samp>&rsquo; is a constant whose value is automatically
set at the start of each iteration of the loop. As such, &lsquo;<samp>index</samp>&rsquo; does
not have to be declared before it is used. It is implicitly declared
simply by its inclusion in the loop declaration, without the need for a
&lsquo;<samp>let</samp>&rsquo; declaration keyword.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need each value from a sequence, you can ignore the values
by using an underscore in place of a variable name.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print(&quot;\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)&quot;)
// Prints &quot;3 to the power of 10 is 59049&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The example above calculates the value of one number to the power of
another (in this case, &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo; to the power of &lsquo;<samp>10</samp>&rsquo;). It multiplies a
starting value of &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; (that is, &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo; to the power of &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo;) by &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo;, ten
times, using a closed range that starts with &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; and ends with &lsquo;<samp>10</samp>&rsquo;. For
this calculation, the individual counter values each time through the
loop are unnecessary&mdash;the code simply executes the loop the correct
number of times. The underscore character (&lsquo;<samp>_</samp>&rsquo;) used in place of a loop
variable causes the individual values to be ignored and does not provide
access to the current value during each iteration of the loop.
</p>
<p>In some situations, you might not want to use closed ranges, which
include both endpoints. Consider drawing the tick marks for every minute
on a watch face. You want to draw &lsquo;<samp>60</samp>&rsquo; tick marks, starting with the &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo;
minute. Use the half-open range operator (&lsquo;<samp>..&lt;</samp>&rsquo;) to include the lower
bound but not the upper bound. For more about ranges, see
<a href="Range-Operators.html#Range-Operators">Range Operators</a>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..&lt;minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}
</pre></div>

<p>Some users might want fewer tick marks in their UI. They could prefer
one mark every &lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo; minutes instead. Use the &lsquo;<samp>stride(from:to:by:)</samp>&rsquo;
function to skip the unwanted marks.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}
</pre></div>

<p>Closed ranges are also available, by using &lsquo;<samp>stride(from:through:by:)</samp>&rsquo;
instead:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
</pre></div>
