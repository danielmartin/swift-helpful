<p>Every time you create a new instance of a class, ARC allocates a chunk
of memory to store information about that instance. This memory holds
information about the type of the instance, together with the values of
any stored properties associated with that instance.
</p>
<p>Additionally, when an instance is no longer needed, ARC frees up the
memory used by that instance so that the memory can be used for other
purposes instead. This ensures that class instances do not take up space
in memory when they are no longer needed.
</p>
<p>However, if ARC were to deallocate an instance that was still in use, it
would no longer be possible to access that instance&rsquo;s properties, or
call that instance&rsquo;s methods. Indeed, if you tried to access the
instance, your app would most likely crash.
</p>
<p>To make sure that instances don&rsquo;t disappear while they are still needed,
ARC tracks how many properties, constants, and variables are currently
referring to each class instance. ARC will not deallocate an instance as
long as at least one active reference to that instance still exists.
</p>
<p>To make this possible, whenever you assign a class instance to a
property, constant, or variable, that property, constant, or variable
makes a <em>strong reference</em> to the instance. The reference is called a
“strong” reference because it keeps a firm hold on that instance, and
does not allow it to be deallocated for as long as that strong reference
remains.
