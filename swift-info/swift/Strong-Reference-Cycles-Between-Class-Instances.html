<p>In the examples above, ARC is able to track the number of references to
the new &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance you create and to deallocate that &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo;
instance when it&rsquo;s no longer needed.
</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s possible to write code in which an instance of a class
<em>never</em> gets to a point where it has zero strong references. This can
happen if two class instances hold a strong reference to each other,
such that each instance keeps the other alive. This is known as a
<em>strong reference cycle</em>.
</p>
<p>You resolve strong reference cycles by defining some of the
relationships between classes as weak or unowned references instead of
as strong references. This process is described in
<a href="Resolving-Strong-Reference-Cycles-Between-Class-Instances.html#Resolving-Strong-Reference-Cycles-Between-Class-Instances">Resolving Strong Reference
Cycles Between Class Instances</a>. However, before you learn how to
resolve a strong reference cycle, it&rsquo;s useful to understand how such a
cycle is caused.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how a strong reference cycle can be created by
accident. This example defines two classes called &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo;, which model a block of apartments and its residents:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Person {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
    var apartment: Apartment?
    deinit { print(&quot;\(name) is being deinitialized&quot;) }
}

class Apartment {
    let unit: String
    init(unit: String) { self.unit = unit }
    var tenant: Person?
    deinit { print(&quot;Apartment \(unit) is being deinitialized&quot;) }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Every &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance has a &lsquo;<samp>name</samp>&rsquo; property of type &lsquo;<samp>String</samp>&rsquo; and an
optional &lsquo;<samp>apartment</samp>&rsquo; property that is initially &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;<samp>apartment</samp>&rsquo;
property is optional, because a person may not always have an apartment.
</p>
<p>Similarly, every &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance has a &lsquo;<samp>unit</samp>&rsquo; property of type
&lsquo;<samp>String</samp>&rsquo; and has an optional &lsquo;<samp>tenant</samp>&rsquo; property that is initially &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;.
The tenant property is optional because an apartment may not always have
a tenant.
</p>
<p>Both of these classes also define a deinitializer, which prints the fact
that an instance of that class is being deinitialized. This enables you
to see whether instances of &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; are being
deallocated as expected.
</p>
<p>This next code snippet defines two variables of optional type called
&lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo;, which will be set to a specific &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance below. Both of these variables have an initial value
of &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, by virtue of being optional:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var john: Person?
var unit4A: Apartment?
</pre></div>

<p>You can now create a specific &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance and &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance
and assign these new instances to the &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo; variables:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">john = Person(name: &quot;John Appleseed&quot;)
unit4A = Apartment(unit: &quot;4A&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the strong references look after creating and assigning these
two instances. The &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; variable now has a strong reference to the new
&lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance, and the &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo; variable has a strong reference to
the new &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance:
</p>
<img src="images/referenceCycle01_2x.png" alt="images/referenceCycle01_2x">
<p>You can now link the two instances together so that the person has an
apartment, and the apartment has a tenant. Note that an exclamation mark
(&lsquo;<samp>!</samp>&rsquo;) is used to unwrap and access the instances stored inside the
&lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo; optional variables, so that the properties of those
instances can be set:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">john!.apartment = unit4A
unit4A!.tenant = john
</pre></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the strong references look after you link the two instances
together:
</p>
<img src="images/referenceCycle02_2x.png" alt="images/referenceCycle02_2x">
<p>Unfortunately, linking these two instances creates a strong reference
cycle between them. The &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance now has a strong reference to
the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance, and the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instance has a strong
reference to the &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance. Therefore, when you break the strong
references held by the &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo; variables, the reference
counts do not drop to zero, and the instances are not deallocated by
ARC:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">john = nil
unit4A = nil
</pre></div>

<p>Note that neither deinitializer was called when you set these two
variables to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;. The strong reference cycle prevents the &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; instances from ever being deallocated, causing a memory leak
in your app.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the strong references look after you set the &lsquo;<samp>john</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>unit4A</samp>&rsquo; variables to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<img src="images/referenceCycle03_2x.png" alt="images/referenceCycle03_2x">
<p>The strong references between the &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; instance and the &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo;
instance remain and cannot be broken.
