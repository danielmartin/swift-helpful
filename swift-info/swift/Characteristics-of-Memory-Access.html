<span id="Characteristics-of-Memory-Access-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">30.1.1 Characteristics of Memory Access</h4>

<p>There are three characteristics of memory access to consider in the
context of conflicting access: whether the access is a read or a write,
the duration of the access, and the location in memory being accessed.
Specifically, a conflict occurs if you have two accesses that meet all
of the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> At least one is a write access.

</li><li> They access the same location in memory.

</li><li> Their durations overlap.
</li></ul>

<p>The difference between a read and write access is usually obvious: a
write access changes the location in memory, but a read access doesn&rsquo;t.
The location in memory refers to what is being accessed&mdash;for example, a
variable, constant, or property. The duration of a memory access is
either instantaneous or long-term.
</p>
<p>An access is <em>instantaneous</em> if it&rsquo;s not possible for other code to run
after that access starts but before it ends. By their nature, two
instantaneous accesses can&rsquo;t happen at the same time. Most memory access
is instantaneous. For example, all the read and write accesses in the
code listing below are instantaneous:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">func oneMore(than number: Int) -&gt; Int {
    return number + 1
}

var myNumber = 1
myNumber = oneMore(than: myNumber)
print(myNumber)
// Prints &quot;2&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>However, there are several ways to access memory, called <em>long-term</em>
accesses, that span the execution of other code. The difference between
instantaneous access and long-term access is that it&rsquo;s possible for
other code to run after a long-term access starts but before it ends,
which is called <em>overlap</em>. A long-term access can overlap with other
long-term accesses and instantaneous accesses.
</p>
<p>Overlapping accesses appear primarily in code that uses in-out
parameters in functions and methods or mutating methods of a structure.
The specific kinds of Swift code that use long-term accesses are
discussed in the sections below.
