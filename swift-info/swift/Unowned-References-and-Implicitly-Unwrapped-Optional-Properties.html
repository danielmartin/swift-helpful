<span id="Unowned-References-and-Implicitly-Unwrapped-Optional-Properties-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">29.4.3 Unowned References and Implicitly Unwrapped Optional Properties</h4>

<p>The examples for weak and unowned references above cover two of the more
common scenarios in which it&rsquo;s necessary to break a strong reference
cycle.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Person</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Apartment</samp>&rsquo; example shows a situation where two
properties, both of which are allowed to be &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, have the potential to
cause a strong reference cycle. This scenario is best resolved with a
weak reference.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Customer</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>CreditCard</samp>&rsquo; example shows a situation where one
property that is allowed to be &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; and another property that cannot be
&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; have the potential to cause a strong reference cycle. This
scenario is best resolved with an unowned reference.
</p>
<p>However, there is a third scenario, in which <em>both</em> properties should
always have a value, and neither property should ever be &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; once
initialization is complete. In this scenario, it&rsquo;s useful to combine an
unowned property on one class with an implicitly unwrapped optional
property on the other class.
</p>
<p>This enables both properties to be accessed directly (without optional
unwrapping) once initialization is complete, while still avoiding a
reference cycle. This section shows you how to set up such a
relationship.
</p>
<p>The example below defines two classes, &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo;, each of
which stores an instance of the other class as a property. In this data
model, every country must always have a capital city, and every city
must always belong to a country. To represent this, the &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; class
has a &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; property, and the &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo; class has a &lsquo;<samp>country</samp>&rsquo;
property:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Country {
    let name: String
    var capitalCity: City!
    init(name: String, capitalName: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.capitalCity = City(name: capitalName, country: self)
    }
}

class City {
    let name: String
    unowned let country: Country
    init(name: String, country: Country) {
        self.name = name
        self.country = country
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>To set up the interdependency between the two classes, the initializer
for &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo; takes a &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; instance, and stores this instance in its
&lsquo;<samp>country</samp>&rsquo; property.
</p>
<p>The initializer for &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo; is called from within the initializer for
&lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo;. However, the initializer for &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; cannot pass &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; to
the &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo; initializer until a new &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; instance is fully
initialized, as described in <a href="Two_002dPhase-Initialization.html#Two_002dPhase-Initialization">Two-Phase
Initialization</a>.
</p>
<p>To cope with this requirement, you declare the &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; property of
&lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; as an implicitly unwrapped optional property, indicated by the
exclamation mark at the end of its type annotation (&lsquo;<samp>City!</samp>&rsquo;). This means
that the &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; property has a default value of &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, like any
other optional, but can be accessed without the need to unwrap its value
as described in <a href="Implicitly-Unwrapped-Optionals.html#Implicitly-Unwrapped-Optionals">Implicitly Unwrapped
Optionals</a>.
</p>
<p>Because &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; has a default &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; value, a new &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo;
instance is considered fully initialized as soon as the &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo;
instance sets its &lsquo;<samp>name</samp>&rsquo; property within its initializer. This means
that the &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; initializer can start to reference and pass around
the implicit &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; property as soon as the &lsquo;<samp>name</samp>&rsquo; property is set. The
&lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; initializer can therefore pass &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; as one of the parameters
for the &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo; initializer when the &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; initializer is setting its
own &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; property.
</p>
<p>All of this means that you can create the &lsquo;<samp>Country</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>City</samp>&rsquo; instances
in a single statement, without creating a strong reference cycle, and
the &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; property can be accessed directly, without needing to
use an exclamation mark to unwrap its optional value:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var country = Country(name: &quot;Canada&quot;, capitalName: &quot;Ottawa&quot;)
print(&quot;\(country.name)'s capital city is called \(country.capitalCity.name)&quot;)
// Prints &quot;Canada's capital city is called Ottawa&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, the use of an implicitly unwrapped optional means
that all of the two-phase class initializer requirements are satisfied.
The &lsquo;<samp>capitalCity</samp>&rsquo; property can be used and accessed like a non-optional
value once initialization is complete, while still avoiding a strong
reference cycle.
