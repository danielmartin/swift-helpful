<p>Swift automatically deallocates your instances when they are no longer
needed, to free up resources. Swift handles the memory management of
instances through <em>automatic reference counting</em> (<em>ARC</em>), as described
in <a href="Automatic-Reference-Counting.html#Automatic-Reference-Counting">Automatic Reference Counting</a>.
Typically you don&rsquo;t need to perform manual cleanup when your instances
are deallocated. However, when you are working with your own resources,
you might need to perform some additional cleanup yourself. For example,
if you create a custom class to open a file and write some data to it,
you might need to close the file before the class instance is
deallocated.
</p>
<p>Class definitions can have at most one deinitializer per class. The
deinitializer does not take any parameters and is written without
parentheses:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">deinit {
 // perform the deinitialization
}
</pre></div>


<p>Deinitializers are called automatically, just before instance
deallocation takes place. You are not allowed to call a deinitializer
yourself. Superclass deinitializers are inherited by their subclasses,
and the superclass deinitializer is called automatically at the end of a
subclass deinitializer implementation. Superclass deinitializers are
always called, even if a subclass does not provide its own
deinitializer.
</p>
<p>Because an instance is not deallocated until after its deinitializer is
called, a deinitializer can access all properties of the instance it is
called on and can modify its behavior based on those properties (such as
looking up the name of a file that needs to be closed).
</p>
