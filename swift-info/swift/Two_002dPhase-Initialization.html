<span id="Two_002dPhase-Initialization-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">19.5.4 Two-Phase Initialization</h4>

<p>Class initialization in Swift is a two-phase process. In the first
phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class
that introduced it. Once the initial state for every stored property has
been determined, the second phase begins, and each class is given the
opportunity to customize its stored properties further before the new
instance is considered ready for use.
</p>
<p>The use of a two-phase initialization process makes initialization safe,
while still giving complete flexibility to each class in a class
hierarchy. Two-phase initialization prevents property values from being
accessed before they are initialized, and prevents property values from
being set to a different value by another initializer unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>Swift&rsquo;s two-phase initialization process is similar to initialization in
Objective-C. The main difference is that during phase 1, Objective-C
assigns zero or null values (such as &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;) to every property.
Swift&rsquo;s initialization flow is more flexible in that it lets you set
custom initial values, and can cope with types for which &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; is
not a valid default value.
</p>
<p>Swift&rsquo;s compiler performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that
two-phase initialization is completed without error:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><strong>Safety check 1</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A designated initializer must ensure that all of
the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it
delegates up to a superclass initializer.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>As mentioned above, the memory for an object is only considered fully
initialized once the initial state of all of its stored properties is
known. In order for this rule to be satisfied, a designated initializer
must make sure that all of its own properties are initialized before it
hands off up the chain.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><strong>Safety check 2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A designated initializer must delegate up to a
superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited
property. If it doesn&rsquo;t, the new value the designated initializer
assigns will be overwritten by the superclass as part of its own
initialization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Safety check 3</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A convenience initializer must delegate to another
initializer before assigning a value to <em>any</em> property (including
properties defined by the same class). If it doesn&rsquo;t, the new value
the convenience initializer assigns will be overwritten by its own
class&rsquo;s designated initializer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Safety check 4</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An initializer cannot call any instance methods,
read the values of any instance properties, or refer to &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; as a
value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The class instance is not fully valid until the first phase ends.
Properties can only be accessed, and methods can only be called, once
the class instance is known to be valid at the end of the first phase.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how two-phase initialization plays out, based on the four safety
checks above:
</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li> A designated or convenience initializer is called on a class.

</li><li> Memory for a new instance of that class is allocated. The memory is
not yet initialized.

</li><li> A designated initializer for that class confirms that all stored
properties introduced by that class have a value. The memory for these
stored properties is now initialized.

</li><li> The designated initializer hands off to a superclass initializer to
perform the same task for its own stored properties.

</li><li> This continues up the class inheritance chain until the top of the
chain is reached.

</li><li> Once the top of the chain is reached, and the final class in the chain
has ensured that all of its stored properties have a value, the
instance&rsquo;s memory is considered to be fully initialized, and phase 1
is complete.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Working back down from the top of the chain, each designated
initializer in the chain has the option to customize the instance
further. Initializers are now able to access &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo; and can modify its
properties, call its instance methods, and so on.

</li><li> Finally, any convenience initializers in the chain have the option to
customize the instance and to work with &lsquo;<samp>self</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how phase 1 looks for an initialization call for a hypothetical
subclass and superclass:
</p>
<img src="images/twoPhaseInitialization01_2x.png" alt="images/twoPhaseInitialization01_2x">
<p>In this example, initialization begins with a call to a convenience
initializer on the subclass. This convenience initializer cannot yet
modify any properties. It delegates across to a designated initializer
from the same class.
</p>
<p>The designated initializer makes sure that all of the subclass&rsquo;s
properties have a value, as per safety check 1. It then calls a
designated initializer on its superclass to continue the initialization
up the chain.
</p>
<p>The superclass&rsquo;s designated initializer makes sure that all of the
superclass properties have a value. There are no further superclasses to
initialize, and so no further delegation is needed.
</p>
<p>As soon as all properties of the superclass have an initial value, its
memory is considered fully initialized, and phase 1 is complete.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how phase 2 looks for the same initialization call:
</p>
<img src="images/twoPhaseInitialization02_2x.png" alt="images/twoPhaseInitialization02_2x">
<p>The superclass&rsquo;s designated initializer now has an opportunity to
customize the instance further (although it does not have to).
</p>
<p>Once the superclass&rsquo;s designated initializer is finished, the subclass&rsquo;s
designated initializer can perform additional customization (although
again, it does not have to).
</p>
<p>Finally, once the subclass&rsquo;s designated initializer is finished, the
convenience initializer that was originally called can perform
additional customization.
